RULES (from Twilio/TCR guidelines):
- Description must clearly explain the campaign's purpose and objective
- Must describe the type of messages that will be sent
- Must not be vague, generic, or too short
- Should mention the target audience
- Should explain the value proposition to message recipients
- Descriptions that just restate the use case name (e.g., "Marketing messages") are rejected

Error code 30886 = "Invalid campaign description" — description was not detailed enough or didn't match the use case.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{"tier": "RED|YELLOW|GREEN", "issues": ["..."], "suggestions": ["..."], "rationale": "..."}

- RED: Description is vague, generic, or fails to explain campaign purpose
- YELLOW: Description is acceptable but could be more detailed
- GREEN: Description is clear, detailed, and explains the campaign well`,
