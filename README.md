# A2PCheck

Pre-scan your A2P 10DLC campaign registration data against Twilio's compliance rules before you submit — catch rejections before they happen.

**Live at [a2pcheck.com](https://a2pcheck.com)**

## What it does

A2PCheck analyzes your 10DLC campaign fields (description, sample messages, opt-in flow, URLs, etc.) and flags issues that commonly cause Twilio/TCR rejections. It combines deterministic rule checks with AI-powered analysis to give you a RED / YELLOW / GREEN tier for each field, along with specific fix suggestions.

### Scanners

| Scanner | Type | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| URLs | Deterministic | URL shorteners, missing URLs, unreachable links |
| Opt-Out Keywords | Deterministic | STOP keyword presence (CTIA requirement) |
| HELP Keywords | Deterministic | HELP keyword presence |
| Content Flags | Deterministic | SHAFT content (sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, tobacco) |
| Campaign Description | AI | Clarity, specificity, use-case alignment |
| Sample Messages | AI | Realistic examples, opt-out language, consistency |
| Opt-In / Consent Flow | AI | Consent mechanism described, TCPA compliance |
| SHAFT Content | AI | Deep check for prohibited content categories |
| Affiliate Marketing | AI | Third-party / lead-gen patterns |
| Privacy Policy | AI + Crawl | SMS/messaging disclosure in privacy policy |
| Terms of Service | AI + Crawl | Messaging terms in ToS |
| Cross-Field Consistency | AI | Description vs. sample messages vs. use case alignment |

## Architecture

```
Next.js frontend (Vercel)  -->  Cloudflare Worker API
                                  |-- Deterministic scanners (instant)
                                  |-- AI scanners (OpenRouter via CF AI Gateway)
                                  |-- Firecrawl (URL content extraction)
                                  |-- D1 database (scan history)
                                  |-- KV (rate limiting)
```

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com) account (for the worker)
- A [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) API key
- Access to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) via Cloudflare AI Gateway

### Worker (API)

```bash
cd worker
npm install
cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml   # Fill in your D1 and KV IDs
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars           # Fill in your API keys
npm run dev                              # Starts on http://localhost:8787
```

### Web (Frontend)

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev                              # Starts on http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend expects the worker API at `http://localhost:8787` during development.

## Environment variables

### Worker secrets (`.dev.vars`)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | Firecrawl API key for URL crawling |
| `AI_GATEWAY_URL` | Cloudflare AI Gateway endpoint (OpenRouter) |
| `CF_AIG_TOKEN` | Cloudflare AI Gateway auth token |

### Worker config (`wrangler.toml`)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated CORS origins |
| `RULES_VERSION` | Scanner rules version string |

See `worker/.dev.vars.example` and `worker/wrangler.toml.example` for full details.

## API

The worker serves an OpenAPI spec at `GET /api/v1/openapi.yaml`.

Key endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/scan` — Full scan (deterministic + AI + URL crawling)
- `POST /api/v1/scan/quick` — Quick scan (deterministic + AI, no URL crawling)
- `GET /api/v1/health` — Health check
